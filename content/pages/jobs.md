Title: Jobs

**Job openings:** 1 post-doc position in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing at Instituto Superior Tecnico, University of Lisbon, Portugal

**Project:** DeepSPIN ("Deep Structured Prediction in Natural Language Processing"), ERC Starting Grant (2018-2023)

**Application deadline:** July 31, 2020

**Job description:**

There is one open position for a postdoctoral researcher in the scope of the ERC project [DeepSPIN](https://deep-spin.github.io) ("Deep Structured Prediction in Natural Language Processing").
The overarching goal of DeepSPIN is to bring together deep learning and structured prediction to solve challenging tasks in natural language processing (e.g., machine translation, visiolinguistic tasks, syntax/semantic parsing).
Three research directions are:

  1. Better planning mechanisms for structural reasoning. This includes efficient use of large contexts and long-term memories, better handling of uncertainty, and research on calibration and confidence estimation methods.  
  2. Induction of interpretable latent structure, exploiting synergies with probabilistic inference and sparse modeling. This includes sparse and structured attention mechanisms, latent variable models, and induction of latent explanations.  
  3. Weak supervision and few-shot learning to reduce the need for labeled data. This includes discrete, semi-supervised latent variable models and modular networks with specialized components.  

See [here](https://deep-spin.github.io) for more information about DeepSPIN, our team, and some of our recent publications.

The specific roles assigned to the project members will take into account their research interests and their background.

The postdoc is a 2-year position, with the possibility of extension up to 4 years. The salary range is 2500-3000 EUR (free of tax), depending on the candidate's experience. The PhD is a 4-year position, with salary range 1500-2000 EUR (free of tax).

This post-doc position can potentially evolve into a ["ELLIS post-doc"](https://ellis.eu/phd-postdoc). and include a visit to an exchange institution in the ELLIS network.

If interested in this position, please send an email with your CV to andre.t.martins AT tecnico.ulisboa.pt. Feel free to contact me for any further information.

**Working environment:**

The host institution ([Instituto de Telecomunicações](http://www.it.pt)) is a leading R&D institution (having hosted 60+ FP7/H2020 projects) located in the campus of [Instituto Superior Técnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en) (IST) at the [University of Lisbon](https://www.ulisboa.pt/en), where I am an Associate Professor.
IST is the top engineering school in Portugal, with 11,000+ students and 700+ faculty members, currently hosting 4 ERC grants.

The host institution is part of the Lisbon Unit for Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems (LUMLIS) and part of the [ELLIS network](https://ellis.eu/units). Collaborations with other ELLIS members are encouraged.

Part of the work may be done in collaboration with [Unbabel](http://www.unbabel.com), a start-up translation company with unique assets (a crowd of 10,000+ human translators, and post-edited translations in 50+ language pairs).

[Lisbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisbon) is one of the oldest cities in Western Europe, being the major political, economic and cultural centre of Portugal. It enjoys a Mediterranean climate, having one of the warmest winters of any metropolis in Europe and a long summer season lasting from June to September. [Portugal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal) has an outstanding coastline and is home to some of the most stunning beaches in Europe, being a popular spot for surfers and other water sport enthusiasts.

Lisbon is also home to the [Lisbon Machine Learning School](http://lxmls.it.pt) (LxMLS), which every year brings together 200+ students and the world leading researchers in machine learning and natural language processing.
