I am an Associate Professor at [Instituto Superior Técnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt), Senior Researcher at the [Instituto de Telecomunicações](http://www.lx.it.pt), and VP of AI Research at [Unbabel](http://unbabel.com) in [Lisbon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisbon), [Portugal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal). I also do scientific consulting for [Priberam Labs](http://labs.priberam.com).
I work on natural language processing and machine learning.

Until 2012, I was a PhD student in the joint CMU-Portugal program in Language Technologies, at [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.cmu.edu) and Instituto Superior Técnico.
My advisors were [Mário Figueiredo](http://www.lx.it.pt/~mtf), [Noah Smith](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~nasmith/), [Pedro Aguiar](http://www.isr.ist.utl.pt/~aguiar) and [Eric Xing](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~epxing).
