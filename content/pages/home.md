I am a Research Scientist at [Unbabel](http://unbabel.com) in [Lisbon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisbon), [Portugal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal).
I work on natural language processing and machine learning.
I am an invited professor at [Instituto Superior Técnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt), a researcher at the [Instituto de Telecomunicações](http://www.lx.it.pt), and I do scientific consulting for [Priberam Labs](http://labs.priberam.com).

Until 2012, I was a PhD student in the joint CMU-Portugal program in Language Technologies, at [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.cmu.edu) and Instituto Superior Técnico.
My advisors were [Mário Figueiredo](http://www.lx.it.pt/~mtf), [Noah Smith](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~nasmith/), [Pedro Aguiar](http://www.isr.ist.utl.pt/~aguiar) and [Eric Xing](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~epxing).

# News

* We have a new EMNLP paper where we propose **SparseMAP** to build dynamic computation graphs via sparse latent structure. Keep posted!
* I gave an invited talk in the [ACL 2018 Workshop on Neural Machine Translation and Generation](https://sites.google.com/site/wnmt18). Here are the [slides](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnx3bm10MTh8Z3g6NzM2ZWNhMTk2MTdlODQ2Yw).
* I am co-organizing LxMLS 2018 (Lisbon Machine Learning School). See [here](http://lxmls.it.pt) for details!
* We have a new [ICML paper](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/niculae18a.html) where we propose *SparseMAP* as a new inference procedure for sparse structured prediction (work done in collaboration with [Vlad Niculae](http://vene.ro), [Mathieu Blondel](http://mblondel.org), and [Claire Cardie](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/cardie)).
* We have a new [ACL short paper](http://aclweb.org/anthology/P18-2059) where we use new forms of sparse and constrained attention within neural machine translation (work done in collaboration with Chaitanya Malaviya and Pedro Ferreira).
* **Great news: I got an ERC (European Research Council) Starting Grant on "Deep Structured Prediction in Natural Language Processing (DeepSPIN)". [I am now looking for Post-Doc and PhD Students](pages/jobs.html).**
* I'm giving an invited talk in the [EMNLP 2017 Workshop on Structured Prediction for NLP](http://structuredprediction.github.io/EMNLP17).
* I gave an invited talk in the [ICML 2017 Workshop on Learning to Generate Natural Language](https://sites.google.com/site/langgen17) and co-organized the [ICML 2017 Workshop on Deep Structured Prediction](https://deepstruct.github.io/ICML17).
* [Our paper on end-to-end differentiable neural-easy first decoders]({filename}/docs/emnlp2017_final.pdf) made it to EMNLP 2017!
* We have a new [TACL paper](https://transacl.org/ojs/index.php/tacl/article/view/1113) where we further improve our quality estimation system by using automatic post-editing as a auxiliary task.
* Our word-level quality estimation system achieved the top score in the First Conference on Machine Translation ([WMT 2016](http://www.statmt.org/wmt16)). Check the paper [here](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W/W16/W16-2387.pdf).
* [Our paper on sparsemax](http://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v48/martins16.pdf) was accepted at [ICML 2016](http://icml.cc/2016). It's a sparse, differentiable, alternative to the softmax activation.
* I joined [Unbabel](http://unbabel.com)! We do AI powered human quality translation.
* I presented a tutorial on "Linear Programming Decoders in NLP" at EMNLP 2014, which covers integer linear programming, message-passing algorithms, and dual decomposition. The slides are available [here]({filename}/docs/emnlp2014tutorial.pdf) and the videos here ([part 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JySNOVdYNgc), [part 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvmzioMGK2Q)).
* Our [TurboSemanticParser](http://labs.priberam.com/Resources/TurboSemanticParser) system achieved the top score in the open track of the [SemEval 2014 task on "Broad-Coverage Semantic Dependency Parsing."](http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2014/task8/) Check the paper [here]({filename}/docs/semeval2014_task8.pdf).
* I presented a tutorial on "Structured Sparsity in NLP" at EACL 2014. The slides are available [here]({filename}/docs/eacl2014tutorial.pdf) (see [here]({filename}/docs/naacl2012tutorial.pdf) for an older version of the same tutorial presented at NAACL 2012).
* I received the Portuguese [IBM Scientific Prize](http://www-05.ibm.com/pt/pc/crct) for my work in structured prediction and "Turbo Parsing."
* I successfully defended my [thesis]({filename}/docs/thesis.pdf) in May 11, 2012, at CMU!
