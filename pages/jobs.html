    <p><strong>Job openings:</strong> 3 Post-doc and 3 PhD students in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing at Instituto Superior Tecnico, University of Lisbon, Portugal</p>
<p><strong>Project:</strong> DeepSPIN ("Deep Structured Prediction in Natural Language Processing"), ERC Starting Grant (2018-2023)</p>
<p><strong>Application deadline:</strong> December 2017</p>
<p><strong>Job description:</strong></p>
<p>There are several open positions for postdoctoral researchers and PhD students in the scope of the ERC project DeepSPIN ("Deep Structured Prediction in Natural Language Processing").
The overarching goal of DeepSPIN is to bring together deep learning and structured prediction to solve challenging tasks in natural language processing, including machine translation, quality estimation, and syntactic parsing.
Three research directions are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Empower neural networks with a planning mechanism for structural search. Connections will be made to reinforcement learning and combinatorial optimization.  </li>
<li>Induction of interpretable latent structure inside the network. This will exploit synergies with probabilistic inference and sparse modeling methods.  </li>
<li>Weak supervision, domain adaptation, and data-driven regularization. This will reduce the need for labeled data.  </li>
</ol>
<p>The specific roles assigned to the project members will take into account their research interests and their background.</p>
<p>The postdoc is a 2-year position, with the possibility of extension up to 4 years. The salary range is 2500-3000 EUR (free of tax), depending on the candidate's experience. The PhD is a 4-year position, with salary range 1500-2000 EUR (free of tax).</p>
<p>If interested in any of these positions, please send an email with your CV to amartins AT lx.it.pt. Feel free to contact me for any further information.</p>
<p><strong>Working environment:</strong></p>
<p>The host institution (<a href="http://www.it.pt">Instituto de Telecomunicações</a>) is a leading R&amp;D institution (having hosted 60+ FP7/H2020 projects) located in the campus of <a href="https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en">Instituto Superior Técnico</a> (IST) at the <a href="https://www.ulisboa.pt/en">University of Lisbon</a>, where I am an Invited Assistant Professor.
IST is the top engineering school in Portugal, with 11,000+ students and 700+ faculty members, currently hosting 4 ERC grants.</p>
<p>Part of the work will be done in collaboration with <a href="http://www.unbabel.com">Unbabel</a>, a start-up translation company with unique assets (a crowd of 10,000+ human translators, and post-edited translations in 50+ language pairs).</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisbon">Lisbon</a> is one of the oldest cities in Western Europe, being the major political, economic and cultural centre of Portugal. It enjoys a Mediterranean climate, having one of the warmest winters of any metropolis in Europe and a long summer season lasting from June to September. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal">Portugal</a> has an outstanding coastline and is home to some of the most stunning beaches in Europe, being a popular spot for surfers and other water sport enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Lisbon is also home to the <a href="http://lxmls.it.pt">Lisbon Machine Learning School</a> (LxMLS), which every year brings together 200+ students and the world leading researchers in machine learning and natural language processing.</p>
