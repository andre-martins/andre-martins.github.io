    <h1>Summary</h1>
<p>Structured prediction is a framework in machine learning which deals with structured and highly interdependent output variables, with applications in natural language processing, computer vision, computational biology, and signal processing.
In the last 5 years, several applications in these areas achieved new breakthroughs by replacing the traditional feature-based linear models by more powerful deep learning models based on neural networks, capable of learning internal representations.</p>
<p>In this course, I will describe methods, models, and algorithms for structured prediction, ranging from "shallow" linear models (hidden Markov models, conditional random fields, structured support vector machines) to modern "deep" learning models (convolutional networks, recurrent neural networks, attention mechanisms, etc.), passing through shallow and deep methods akin to reinforcement learning. Representation learning will also be discussed (PCA, auto-encoders, and various deep generative models).
The theoretical concepts taught in this course will be complemented by a strong practical component, by letting students work in group projects where they can solve practical problems by using software suitable for deep learning (e.g., Pytorch, TensorFlow, DyNet).</p>
<h1>Syllabus</h1>
<p>Stay tuned!</p>
